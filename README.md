# Wumpus_World
The Wumpus world is a cave with n/n rooms and pathways connecting them. As a result, there are a total of n^2 rooms that are interconnected. We now have a knowledge-based AI capable of progressing in this world. There is an area in the cave with a beast named Wumpus who eats everybody who enters. The agent can shoot the Wumpus, but he only has a single arrow. There are some Pits chambers in the Wumpus world that are bottomless, and if an agent falls into one, he will be stuck there indefinitely. The intriguing thing about this cave is that there is a chance of finding a gold heap in one of the rooms. So the agent's mission is to find the gold and get out of the cave without getting eaten by Wumpus or falling into Pits. the agent returns with gold, he will be rewarded, but if he is devoured by Wumpus or falls into the pit, he will be penalized.

Our project is Monsters Inc theme based, and consists of customizable settings. Not much to see as the agent plays on its own, but still, enjoy!
